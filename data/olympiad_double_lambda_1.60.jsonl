{"prompt": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$.

Use the markdown bullet points such as:\n* This is point 1. \n* This is point 2 Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks. ", "response": ["To find the largest two-digit number that becomes \\(75\\%\\) greater when its digits are reversed, we start by letting the original two-digit number be represented as \\(10a + b\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are its digits, and \\(a\\) is a non-zero digit (since it is a two-digit number).\n\nWhen the digits are reversed, the new number becomes \\(10b + a\\). According to the problem, the reversed number is \\(75\\%\\) more than the original number. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[10b + a = 10a + b + 0.75(10a + b)\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[10b + a = 10a + b + 7.5a + 0.75b\\]\n\\[10b + a = 17.5a + 1.75b\\]\n\nNext, we rearrange terms to isolate like terms on one side:\n\n\\[10b - 1.75b = 17.5a - a\\]\n\\[8.25b = 16.5a\\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2.5:\n\n\\[3.3b = 6.6a\\]\n\\[b = 2a\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are digits (synthesize from 0 to 9), and given that \\(b = 2a\\), the possible values for \\(a\\) are limited because \\(b\\) must also be a digit. The only value for \\(a\\) that satisfies these conditions is \\(a = 4\\) (since if \\(a = 5\\), then \\(b = 10 > 9\\)).\n\nThus, \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 2a = 8\\). Therefore, the original number is \\(10a + b = 10 \\cdot 4 + 8 = 48\\).\n\nTo verify, we reverse the digits of 48 to get 84. We check if reversing the digits increases the number by \\(75\\%\\):\n\nThe increase in the number is \\(84 - 48 = 36\\), which is indeed \\(75\\%\\) of 48 (since \\(0.75 \\times 48 = 36\\)).\n\nTherefore, the largest two-digit number that meets the criteria is \\(\\boxed{48}\\)."]}
