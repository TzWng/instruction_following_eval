{"prompt": "Kindly summarize the text below in XML format. Make sure the summary contains less than 4 sentences.\n\nQuantum entanglement is the phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "response": "In 1964, John Stewart Bell demonstrated that predictions of quantum theory can be violated if the system being observed violates Bell's inequality. This theoretical result was experimentally confirmed by Alain Aspect and others starting in the early 1980s, and has since been confirmed by many other experiments. The possibility of such violations means that entanglement cannot be explained by any local hidden-variable theory; in particular, it means that entanglement necessarily implies nonlocality. The question of whether nonlocality can be used for faster-than-light communication remains an open and controversial issue.\n\n<summary>\n<content>\nQuantum"}

{"prompt": "If a + b = 10. And a > b. Is a = 6? Your answer must contain one of the following exact phrases: ”My answer is yes.\", \"My answer is no.\", \"My answer is maybe.\"", "response": ".\nMy answer is maybe. \n\nThis is because there are many possible values for a and b that satisfy the equation a + b = 10 and the condition a > b. For example, a could be 7 and b could be 3, or a could be 8 and b could be 2. In both cases, a is greater than b, but a is not equal to 6."}
{"prompt": "If a + b + c = 30 and b = 10 and c = 5. Is a = 20? Answer ”My answer is yes.\" or \"My answer is no.\" or \"My answer is maybe.\"", "response": "My answer is yes. \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given that a + b + c = 30.\n2. We are also given that b = 10 and c = 5.\n3. If we substitute the values of b and c into the equation, we get a + 10 + 5 = 30.\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get a + 15 = 30.\n5. To find the value of a, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation, which gives us a = 15."}
